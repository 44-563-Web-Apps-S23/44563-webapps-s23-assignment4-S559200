<h1>Roshini Bikkina snips a play</h1>
<h6>THE TWELVE-POUND LOOK by Sir James M. Barrie</h6>
<p>SIR HARRY. [_Like an auctioneer._] Noted for her wit.</p>
<br>
<p>
<h6>KATE</h6>. All her life before her when that was painted. It is a
_spirituelle_ face too. [_Suddenly she turns on him with anger, for the
first and only time in the play._] Oh, Harry, you brute!
</p>
<br>
<p>
<h6>SIR HARRY</h6>. [_Staggered._] Eh? What?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<h6>KATE</h6>. That dear creature, capable of becoming a noble wife and
mother--she is the spiritless woman of no account that I saw here a few
minutes ago. I forgive you for myself, for I escaped, but that poor lost
soul, oh, Harry, Harry.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<h6>SIR HARRY</h6>. [_Waving her to the door._] I'll thank you--If ever there
was a woman proud of her husband and happy in her married life, that
woman is Lady Sims.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<h6>KATE</h6>. I wonder.
</p>
<br>
<h6>SIR HARRY</h6>. Then you needn't wonder.
<p>
<h6>KATE</h6>. [_Slowly._] If I was a husband--it is my advice to all of them--I
would often watch my wife quietly to see whether the twelve-pound look
was not coming into her eyes. Two boys, did you say, and both like you?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<h6>SIR HARRY</h6>. What is that to you?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<h6>KATE</h6>. [_With glistening eyes_.] I was only thinking that somewhere there
are two little girls who, when they grow up--the dear, pretty girls who
are all meant for the men that don't get on! Well, good-by, Sir Harry.
